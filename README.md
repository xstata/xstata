This repository serves two main purposes:
- Homepage of the course "Stata Labs for Introductory Econometrics" in School of Management, Xiamen Universiy, PRC.
- Deploying some Stata packages (written by me) aiming at:
    - improving students' *learning experience* (especially with Stata)
    - simplifing and facilitating *reproducible research workflows*
